# Python Projects

This repository showcases a collection of small Python projects, built for learning, experimentation, and practical application.

## About

This repository serves as a personal portfolio of my Python development journey. It contains a diverse range of projects, demonstrating my exploration of various Python libraries, concepts, and problem-solving techniques. The projects cover a variety of areas, including scripting, data manipulation, automation, and more.

## Contents

This repository includes a series of self-contained Python projects, each designed to address a specific task or explore a particular concept. You will find:

* Small Scripts: Automating tasks, file processing, and system interactions.
* Data Manipulation: Working with data structures, APIs, and data analysis.
* Utility Tools: Command-line applications and helper functions.
* Learning Projects: Demonstrating core Python concepts and library usage.

Each project is located in its own directory, making it easy to browse and explore.

## Getting Started

To explore the projects:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/snehasish-05/python.git](https://github.com/snehasish-05/python.git)
    cd python
    ```

2.  Navigate to the directory of the project you're interested in.

3.  Follow any specific instructions within the project's directory (if provided).

## Dependencies
